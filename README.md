Jumping into my debut HTML/CSS project!

Behold, my first attempt: initially confident, but ended up resorting to copying the source code. 🤷‍♂️ Later, it dawned on me: this is all part of the learning journey.

Admittedly, I may have 'borrowed' a snippet of CSS at the end. 😉

Here's to fresh starts and brighter tomorrows! 🌟
